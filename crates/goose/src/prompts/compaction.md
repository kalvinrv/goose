## Task Context
- An llm context limit was reached when a user was in a working session with an agent (you)
- Distill the conversation below into a structured summary with only the most verbose parts removed
- Include user requests, your responses, all technical content, and as much of the original context as possible
- This will be used to let the user continue the working session
- The summary will be read by an agent (you) on a next exchange to allow for continuation of the session

**Conversation History:**
{{ messages }}

Wrap reasoning in `<analysis>` tags:
- Review conversation chronologically
- For each part, log:
  - User goals and requests
  - Your method and solution
  - Key decisions and designs
  - File names, code, signatures, errors, fixes
- Highlight user feedback and revisions
- Confirm completeness and accuracy

After the closing `</analysis>` tag, output exactly one ```json code block and nothing else, matching this schema:

```json
{
  "user_intent": ["every user goal and request, most important first"],
  "technical_concepts": ["all discussed tools, methods, and concepts"],
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "path of a file that was viewed or edited",
      "summary": "what was done to it and why",
      "key_code": "important code, signatures, or diffs from this file (omit if none)"
    }
  ],
  "errors_and_fixes": ["bugs hit, their resolutions, and user-driven changes"],
  "problem_solving": ["issues solved or in progress"],
  "user_messages": ["all user messages, truncating long tool call arguments or results"],
  "pending_tasks": ["all unresolved user requests, most important first"],
  "current_work": "active work at summary request time: filenames, code, alignment to latest instruction",
  "next_step": "include only if it directly continues a user instruction, otherwise omit"
}
```

Rules for the JSON:
- The `<analysis>` block is a discarded scratchpad: only the JSON survives, so it must be self-contained and repeat every detail from the analysis that matters for continuing
- Order every list from most to least important
- This summary will only be read by you, so it is ok to make it much longer than a normal summary you would show to a human
- Do not exclude any information that might be important to continuing a session working with you
- Omit a field rather than inventing content for it
- No new ideas unless user confirmed
